# Dino Trivia Expedition

A dinosaur-themed, multi-level trivia game for Kindergarten through 3rd grade learners. The adventure covers science, U.S. history, geography, phonics, geometry, simple music concepts, sports (football, soccer, basketball, lacrosse, baseball), and pattern recognition. Scores are tracked per session and cumulatively using local storage.

## How to play
1. Open `index.html` locally or host the folder with GitHub Pages/any static server.
2. Click **Start Adventure** to begin Level 1 and answer each multiple-choice question.
3. Move through four levels that increase in difficulty; finish the final level to bank your fossil points into the cumulative total.
4. Use **Reset Fossils** to clear the cumulative score and session count if you want a fresh tally.

## Notes
- Progress, session totals, and cumulative fossils are stored in your browser, so they persist across visits on the same device.
- Animations and colors are pure CSS—no external dependencies beyond Google Fonts.
- Question sets live in `script.js` under `levelData` and can be edited or expanded easily.
